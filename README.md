## Amazon EventBridge Integration Solution: Store end-user data in DynamoDB in real-time 

This Quick Start deploys an integration with AWS DynamoDB, AWS Lambda and AWS SNS for Amazon EventBridge SaaS Partner Integrations with PLAID. 
The solution leverages KARTE's customer service actions to send any end-user's data to the Amazon EventBridge event bus and store the data in DynamoDB via AWS SNS and AWS Lambda when the events are matched.

With low code, KARTE user data can be stored in real time in various DBs such as DynamoDB on AWS. By using this data in your system, you can improve the expressiveness of your system more flexibly.
